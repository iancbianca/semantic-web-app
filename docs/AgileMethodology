Agile is software development methodology. It is very 
effective where Client frequently changes his requirement.
Since it has more iteration so you can assure a solution 
that meets clients requirement.
More than one build deployement for a project.
It involves more client interection and testing effort.
The steps in volved are : Scope,Define,Develop,Evaulate

There are two methods by which this methodology can be 
implemented:-

1- Scrum
2- Extreme Progamming

Scrum: 
======
Each iteration would called a scrum and can be of 1-
2 Months length.In Scrum, the client prioritizes his requirements what 
he wants to get done first. If developer did not meets all the 
requirement which was being fixed for a particular scrum, 
rest of the development part would be transferred to 
the next scrum (would be delivered in next build),  
which means, developer cann't increase time decided for a scrum.
Its fixed.

Extreme Programming (XP): 
========================
Iteration period would be less then that in scrum. It is approximately 2-4 weeks.
Here, the developer prioritizes what to do first on the basis of 
client requirement.
The duration, which was fixed for a iteration, could be 
increased if some development part was pending. 
The build would be deployed with having all that what client needs.
Thus, iteration period is not fixed, it can increase. The iteration should meets all the client's requirement in 
this build.More attention is required for testing in XP.

 Agile Methodology- Characteristics

-  Frequent Delivery

-  More Iterations

-  Test frequently

-  Less defects
