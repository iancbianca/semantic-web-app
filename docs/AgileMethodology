Agile is software development methodology. It is very 
effective where Client frequently changes his requirement.
Since it has more iteration so you can assure a solution 
that meets clients requirement.
More than one build deployement for a project.
It involves more client interection and testing effort.
The steps in volved are : Scope,Define,Develop,Evaulate

There are two methods by which this methodology can be 
implemented:-

1- Scrum
2- Extreme Progamming

Scrum: 
======
Each iteration would called a scrum which can be a 1-
2 Months.In Scrum Client prioritise his requirements what 
he want first. If developer did not meets all the 
requirement which was being fixed for a perticular scrum 
than rest of the development part would be transferred to 
the next scrum (would be delievered in the next build),  
means developer cann't increase time decided for a scrum.
Its fixed.

Extreme Programming (XP): 
========================
here iteration period would be 
less then in scrum , which is being 2-4 weeks.
Here developer prioritise what to do first on the basis of 
client requirement.
This duration which was being fixed for a iteration, can be 
increase if the some development part is still pending. 
The build would deployed with having all the client needs.
Thus iteration period is not fixed here it can be increase.
but iteration should meets all the client's requirement in 
this build.

More attension is required for testing in XP.
